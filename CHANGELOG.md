# What is Changed

## 34.0.0 **Biggest Update Ever!**

This is the biggest changes that has ever happened to this theme!
For a long time I've heard people complaining about the bright background
of the light theme. As you know, I create this theme for myself first and
at some point, my eyes too, became tired of reading the comments on the light
theme. So, I changed the comment colors in V32. But it didn't finish there.
In this version I'm introducing two major changes to the theme: __New Background
and Foreground Colors__. You may love it or resent it, but your eyes are going
to thank me, believe me!

These two updates are so big that deserved their own big major version bump,
but it doesn't stop there.

- **Massive Change!** &mdash; New Light Background Color!
- **Massive Change!** &mdash; New Light Foreground Color!
- **Massive Change!** &mdash; ProColors now Supports the Full Semantic Token Standard! This is a huge improvement over most languages.
- **New!** &mdash; Custom colorization for the Ghost texts. (Suggestions of the AI Assistants like Copilot)
- **New!** &mdash; Custom colorization for Flutter extension's guides.
- **New!** &mdash; Custom colorization for the Debug View.
- **New!** &mdash; Custom colorization for the Debug Console.
- **New!** &mdash; Custom colorization for Flutter extension's guides.
- **New!** &mdash; Custom colorization for Comment View.

## 31.1.0
- **Hot Fix!** &mdash; Hot fix on the icon colors. Seems that blue is not awesome.

## 32.0.0
- **Improvement!** &mdash; New Comment Color for the Light Theme: The comment color of the Pro Colors has always been an iconic part of its identity and therefore hard to change, but it was hard for the eye to see and from this version a new color that is really easy on the eye and still in harmony with the theme is presented. Hope you like it as much as I do (and make sure to give it a little bit of time to become natural to you.)

- **Improvement!** &mdash; New Panel Color for the Light Theme: Like the comment color, the panel had a look that was too much similar to th editor and that made it hard to distinguish. From this version the panel is painted in blue which is really easy on the eye and hopefully beautiful.
