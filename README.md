## Icons
This theme includes two minimalistic icon packs that are carefully choosen for the style and coloring of this theme. The icons in these sets are designed by [AnhGreen](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/anhgreen) and [Kiranshastry](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/kiranshastry).

## The theme…
This theme works great on many file formats but it works even better on some very special formats because we provide first class support which means each token of these languages are specifically themed and they will look sublime when you work with them in this theme.

## Good font to use with this theme?
To use it best, we suggest you use the medium weight of [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig) typeface. It's a fork of [Adobe Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro) with programmer ligatures. Our theme is the best match to this typeface.
