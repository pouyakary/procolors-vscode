## Your workbench redesigned.
Given the possibilities and limitations we have tired our best to fully recolor Visual Studio Code to a new level and make it an entirely new experience which we really hope you like and enjoy!

## The themeâ€¦
This theme works great on many file formats but it works even better on some very special formats because we provide first class support which means each token of these languages are specifically themed and they will look sublime when you work with them in this theme.

## Good font to use with this theme?
To use it best, we suggest you use the medium weight of [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig) typeface. It's a fork of [Adobe Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro) with programmer ligatures. Our theme is the best match to this typeface.
